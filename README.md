## Description
Using state-of-the-art NLP techniques, Correkt labels misinformation as soon as it appears on screen, highlighting false statements before generating a short excerpt and list of citations to verify its claims. Powered by a retrieval augmented transformer network that achieves over 93% accuracy on the 12.8K LIAR benchmark dataset, we provide an effective, user-friendly way to banish misinformation from your scrollspace. Our model was trained on over 40k real-world statements scraped from reputable fact-checking websites like Poynter and Politifact, while drawing from a retrieval set of over 21 million passages scraped from Wikipedia, the Washington Post, NYT, and more, providing a level of accuracy, accessibility, and speed that traditional fact-checking just can't match.
